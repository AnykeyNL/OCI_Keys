# OCI_Keys
Code to auto generate SSH and PEM keyfiles for OCI

## Why?
I have been organizing hands-on workshop for the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and found that people (especially windows-based users) struggle creating the right kind of key files for OCI. 

OCI requires a different format for SSH access compared to API access.

This code you can run on a webserver and will automatically create private and piblic key files in both PEM (API access) and SSH format.

You can test it out here:
